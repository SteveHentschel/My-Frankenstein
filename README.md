My first pet project: a Monster Database using C# .NET MVC3 w/ SQL Express in Visual Studio 2010.

MF Rev 1.1.0 -- (11/15/13)
- Added image file upload process to Create (still working on Edit)
- Added image displays to Details and Delete views
-- Working on image file in Edit (no upload if not changed), and deleting image file when monster record is Deleted

MF Rev 1.0.0 -- Base (11/13/13)
- Initial monster database, allocated DB and classes, basic CRUD working
- User login check to create records, user match in place to edit/delete records.
- Images not implemented yet, still not pretty.  slh
